# dirtional-matrix-traversal
Right now there are no unit tests, only A main class that calls the the traversal matrix class.

I believe the method has time complexity of O(_n_) and time complextity is O(_n_) where _n_ is the number of cells in the matrix

# Data structure
The data structure could vary from multi dimensional array or Maps or whatever, but it depends on the usecase and what is the average size of the input data set. This implementaion uses 2 dimension arrays for simplicity because the usecase is unknown

# Ensuring the correctness of the solution
- Edge cases analysis needs to be done to ensure all cases are handled
- Automated tests are mandatory to ensure the correctness of the solution
- Proper error handling is also needed

# To try
To try this code copy paste the content of the Mainj.java file in an online IDE like https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/ and use java 11 and run
